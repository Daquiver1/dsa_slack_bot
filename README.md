# slackbot-tutorial

Code/tutorial updated to reflect Slack API v1 -> v2 changes. [Updated tutorial is available on Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-basic-slackbot-a-beginners-guide-6b40507db5c5) as I cannot edit the content on freeCodeCamp's website.

Used in conjunction with this [tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-basic-slackbot-a-beginners-guide-6b40507db5c5)
